# METARUtility
Creating an Android Application that can report Meteorological Aerodrome Reports from an API and display it to a user via a graphical user interface.

This application will query the user for a 4-letter ICAO code, then look up the relevant METAR information and the airport information and display it to the user. The data is from the open source AVWX REST API for Aviation Weather.
